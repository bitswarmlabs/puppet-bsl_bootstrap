# bsl_bootstrap

Puppet module to create an init script which will run a pre-baked paramterized `puppet apply` in order to provide minimal provisioning generally for the purposes of first run finalization.

Used primarily by the [bsl_puppet](https://github.com/bitswarmlabs/puppet-bsl_puppet) module to complete network and certificate generation for puppetmaster.
